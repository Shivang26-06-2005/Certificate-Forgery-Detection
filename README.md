# Certificate-Forgery-Detection-
This is a AI detection tool which can detect the regions in a Certificate and detect whether certificates are genuine or tampered
This uses two datasets from ROBOFLOW which includes certificates.First dataset is used for detection of regions in Certificate while another dataset is used to detect if the certificates are genuine or fake
This project uses two models and uses YOLO-8 as a object detection tool for detection.The first model is used to detect the important regions in a Certificate and another model is used to detect genuity of the same
certificate.
